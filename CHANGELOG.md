# Changelog

## 0.1.0 (2026-11-13)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* modules/aws and modules/google replace manifests_semver with image = { semver, channel }, and no longer publish GITHUB_ARC_MANIFESTS_SEMVER or SIGNED_IDENTITY_GITHUB_ARC_MANIFESTS. The image's trees move from ./deploy/<tree> to ./<tree>, so a cluster on this module version needs an image built from this commit or later: apply only after its edge build is published.
* releases are tagged vX.Y.Z (promoted edge builds) instead of X.Y.Z, the edge/staging/stable/edge-next tags are gone, and the default signed_identity_subject is now release.yaml@refs/heads/main: re-apply the modules so clusters verify the new identity before the first release under this version.
